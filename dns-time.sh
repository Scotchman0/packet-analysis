# dns-times.sh begins on the previous line
#
# This macro uses tshark to find DNS (port 53) queries and calculate the
# time between query and response. It differs from the dns.time value
# caculated by wireshark in that it calculates the time between the first
# response for transaction ID X and the first query for transaction X not
# the first response and last query for transaction X.
#
# The output is three tables.
#
# The first table is how fast a name server responded toa query. It has the
# following columns.
#     Server ID Type Name Rcode Response-time - Query-time = Delta-time
#
# The second table list unanswered queries. It has the columns
#     Server ID Type Name Query-time
#
# The third table takes into account what the application making the query
# sees if the client uses multiple name servers and the first servers do not
# respond. If the client uses only 1 name server this table and table 1 should
# be identical. Also if the client uses a different transaction ID for each
# name server this table will be inaccurate. The columns for this table are
#     Client ID Type Name Rcode Response-time - Query-time = Delta-time

# Type ==  1 Type A host address
# Type == 12 domain name PRT query
# Type == 28 Type AAAA IPv6 host address
#
# Rcode == 0 normal, no error response
# Rcode == 2 Server failure
# Rcode == 3 No such name
#
# Version 1.0 March 15, 2017
# Version 1.1 April 01, 2017
#    Added copyright and GNU GPL statement and disclaimer
# Version 1.3 October 7, 2017
#    Added a check to make sure that the found response has 1 query. If not
#    just skip it. Had a trace with multiple responses and no queries. Also
#    removed non-printing characters from the output. Queries had control
#    characters and bytyes > 127 in the names and the causes column to barf.
#    Finally check that the output line in /tmp/dns-time-1 has all 13 fields.
#    Had some malformed queries that did not have all the fields and that
#    screwed things up as well.
# Version 1.4 October 12, 2017
#    Added support for IPv6 client and server addresses
# Version 1.5 February 13, 2018
#    Added the dns.flags.rcode to the output to distinguish between a 
#    response that actually provided an answer and one which did not. Also
#    added some comments for various DNS types and rcodes.
# Version 1.6 October 20, 2019
#    Added a third table to take into account what the application sees if
#    the client host uses multiple name servers and the first servers do not
#    respond. Thank you to Curtis Taylor for pointing out this omission.
