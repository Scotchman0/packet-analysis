<p>
This macro uses tshark to make 2N+1 passes (a large file with lots of retransmissions will be slow) through a file. The first pass identifies all retransmitted TCP segments and extracts the starting sequence number from those segments. Then for each identified segment it finds all segments which include the starting sequence number. It then finds the first ACK for that sequence number.
<p>
If this macro is run over a trace that was captured on the receiving host we can see if the original segment was seen and if so if an ACK was sent. If this macro is run over a trace that was captured in the sending host we can see if an ACK was received before the retransmitted segment was sent.
<p>
The Output file has the format
<br>
TCP Seq NNNNNNN Pattern: PPPPPP
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspframe.number tcp.time_relative ip.src ip.ttl ip.dst tcp.seq tcp.ack tcp.nxtseq
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspframe.number tcp.time_relative ip.src ip.ttl ip.dst tcp.seq tcp.ack tcp.nxtseq
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspframe.number tcp.time_relative ip.src ip.ttl ip.dst tcp.seq tcp.ack tcp.nxtseq
<p>
Multiple frames from the sending IP indicate that the frame was received (or sent) multiple times. The placement of the ACK from the receiving IP indicates when the ACK was sent.
<p>
The pattern string PPPPPP represents the pattern of segments.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspD-A-   would indicate the first segment is data followed by an ACK
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspD-D-A- would be data, data again and then an ACK
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspD-A-D- would be data and ack and then data again. We do not see the second ACK because only the first ACK is recorded.
<p>
Counting the unique patterns will give you an idea of the segment loss pattern
<p>
If the input file is large with many TCP streams it would make sense to first create a file containing just the segments of the TCP stream of interest.
<p>
If there are enough segments that the sequence numbers wrap and are reused this will probably result in false positives (or negatives, it depends on your point of view). If this is the case the trace file should be broken up so that the sequence number space is not reused. Note that a sequence number wrap is OK, it is when it wraps and proceeds past where it originally started that things get messy.

<b><h3>Usage</h3></b>
local-drops.sh FILE-NAME SRC-ADDR TCP-PORT OUTPUT-FILE
<br><br>
<b>FILE-NAME</b>
<br>
The file name (or path to the file), This file must be readable by tshark.
<br><br>
<b>SRC-ADDR</b>
<br>
The source IP address of the sender.
<br><br>
<b>TCP-PORT</b>
<br>
Is the client side TCP port. It may be long to the sender or the receiver. It is just to make sure that only 1 TCP stream is evaluated.
<br><br>
<b>OUTPUT-FILE</b>
<br>
The file name (or path) to an output file.
<br><br>

<b><h3>Examples</h3></b>

Example 1a - trace collected on the receiver. Note that it took approximately 30 minutes to run through the trace with 14,898 packets and 611 retransmissions in the selected stream.

Example 1c - summary of the data-ACK pattern. In 491 cases there is a data segment followed by the ACK so the probability is that the original data segment was lost. In 94 cases there is an ACK after the data segment and that is followed by another data segment. Chances are that the original ACK was lost. The subsequent ACK is not listed because the script only lists the first ACK. There are also 26 cases of two data segments and then an ACK. It is possible that the original data segment was dropped at the socket level.

Example 1d - Given the length of time the script takes to run it is nice to be able to monitor its progress. The script writes out the number of retransmissions after the first pass. You can grep for that number early on and then count the number of "TCP" lines to get some idea of the progress.

Example 2 - trace collected on the sender. Note that the sender IP address 172.29.26.124 is shown with an IP TTL of 64 in the trace output indicating that the packets have not gone through a router. Also note the data-ACK pattern. In all cases there are multiple data packets before the ACK.
