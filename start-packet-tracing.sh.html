<p>
This macro starts tcpdump to record packets using a ring buffer of 10 files of 100 megabytes each. The process is placed in the background. So do not forget to kill the process when you are done.
<p>

<b><h3>Usage</h3></b>
start-packet-tracing.sh DEVICE OUTPUT-FILE [[LENGTH [FILTER]]
<br><br>
<b>DEVICE</b>
<br>
Is the name of the device to trace on
<br><br>
<b>OUTPUT-FILE</b>
<br>
The base name of the file to write the packets to. 
<br><br>
<b>LENGTH</b>
<br>
The maximum number of bytes from each frame that will be captured and writen as part of the output file.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp0 indicates that the entire frame should be captured
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp114 is the default and will capture the entire Ethernet/IP/TCP header assuming there are no IP options. If the header does not use all 40 bytes of options you will also capture some of the TCP data. UDP headers are smaller so some UDP data will also be captured"
<br><br>
<b>FILTER</b>
<br>
Is a tcpdump filter string to limit what is captured. The default is the null string which will capture everything. If you want to include a filter you must include the length argument. If FILTER is specified you must also specify the LENGTH.
<br><br>


<b><h3>Examples</h3></b>

Example 1 - minimum arguments just the device and file name. Note the 10 files names wlp5s0.pcap0 through wlp5s0.pcap9. Based on the dates we know that wlp5s0.pcap2 is the earliest with wlp5s0.pcap1 the latest. So wlp5s0.pcap0 and wlp5s0.pcap1 have been overwritten by later data. Note also the file sizes are slightly larger than the 100 MB limit. As long as the file size is less than the 100 MB limit the current record is written to the file and that record can push the file size to greater than the 100 MB limit. Depending on the record it can be up to 64K greater.

Example 2 - Adding in a filter to capture only traffic over port 22. Note that I added a 0 for the length argument. The ps command can be used to show the tcpdump arguments. The table shows that all packets in the trace had either a destination port of 22 or a source port of 22 even though there was also HTTP and HTTPS traffic using the interface.
